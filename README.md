## Project Details

This is a small social media platform, I'm creating in my free time for my friends and for the students of Laval university.
We just need something that belongs to us, away from all the noise and the distruction of other platforms.

In terms of technology, I'm using NextJS for the frontend, and Firebase for backend.
The design is heavily inspired by instagram.
